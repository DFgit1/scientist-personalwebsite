                    <p>I am a astrophysicist from Calgary, Alberta. On a daily basis, My team and I employ the methods
                        and principles of physics and chemistry in the study of astronomical objects and phenomena. Who
                        knows what new and exciting things we will discover!</p>

                    <p>Convergent disk migration has long been suspected to be responsible for forming planetary systems
                        with a chain of mean-motion resonances (MMR). Dynamical evolution over time could disrupt the
                        delicate resonant configuration.

                graveyard of dead stars found</a>
            <p>The first map of the 'galactic underworld' -- a chart of the corpses of once massive suns that have since
                collapsed into black holes and neutron stars -- has revealed a graveyard that stretches three times the
                height of the Milky Way, and that almost a third of the objects have been flung out from the galaxy
                altogether.</p>

                traces of the universe's earliest stars</a>
            <p>Astronomers may have discovered the ancient chemical remains of the first stars to light up the Universe.
                Using an innovative analysis of a distant quasar observed by the 8.1-meter Gemini North telescope on
                Hawai'i, the scientists found an unusual ratio of elements that, they argue, could only come from the
                debris produced by the all-consuming explosion of a 300-solar-mass first-generation star.</p>

                capture detailed views of DART impact</a>
            <p>Two of NASA's Great Observatories, the James Webb Space Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope, have
                captured views of a unique NASA experiment designed to intentionally smash a spacecraft into a small
                asteroid in the world's first-ever in-space test for planetary defense. These observations of NASA's
                Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) impact mark the first time that Webb and Hubble simultaneously
                observed the same celestial target.</p>
